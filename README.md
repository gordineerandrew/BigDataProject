2. Describe the area of focus you and your partner chose to explore and explain why you chose this area. Your answer should be **no more than 200 words.**  (5 points)
3.	List the set of three to five questions you sought to answer. (3 points) 
4.	Identify each permanent data set you used. For each set, you must: (5 points)
  - Provide the permanent URL.
  - Briefly describe the data set. **Each description should be no more than 100 words.**
  - Provide the date on which you accessed each data set. 
5.	Clearly present the answer to each of the questions you investigated. Each answer should be **no more than 200 words.** Attach and reference any appropriate non-textual representations. Include a one sentence description of each non-textual attachment. (10 points)
6.	Explain how your questions and answers contribute to the development of insight and knowledge in your chosen area of inquiry. Your explanation should be **no more than 300 words.** Attach (as pdfs) and reference any appropriate non-textual representations. Include a one-sentence description of each non-textual attachment. (5 points)

## Explanation of Individual Report
On your own, respond directly to each of the following prompts: 

Investigation
1.	Explain why your questions are rich enough and your data set(s) are large enough to require the use of computation to analyze the data and answer your questions. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** (5 points)
2.	Explain why your group selected the data set(s) used in your investigation. Your explanation should be **no more than 200 words.** (5 points)
3.	Describe and justify the specific computational tools (visualization software, spreadsheet, statistical package, etc.) and techniques (filtering, clustering, visualizing, analyzing, etc.) your group used. Provide a detailed description of how your group processed the information in the data set(s) to conduct the investigation and how this process enabled you to meet your objective of gaining insight and knowledge. This description should be sufficiently detailed to make it clear that you could conduct the investigation on your own. It should also include sufficient detail to allow a reasonably skilled reader to use the tools and techniques to replicate the investigation and verify the results. Your description should be **no more than 700 words;** the following questions may help guide your writing. (10 points)
  - What challenges did you face in finding the data sources?
  - Did the data require any filtering or cleaning? If so, how did you process the data?
  - Did you do any clustering or classifying of your data? If so, how? 
  - Did you translate or transform the data to determine patterns? If so, how? 
  - Did you use any tools to visualize your data? If so, which tools? How did you use them?
  - Was the size of your data set a challenge? If so, how did you address the challenge?

## Explanation of Peer Review

Reflect on the collaborative process your group used to do the research.  
Answer the following questions, keeping your answers at a strategic level 
rather than an operational level. For example, talk about how and why you 
divided the tasks, but not what time and for how long you met with your group. 
Your answer should be no more than 300 words. Include answers to the following 
questions: (10 points)
1.	How did you share or divide the work?
2.	Why did you choose to divide the work in this way?
3.	How did you coordinate your efforts? 
4.	What worked well, and what did not work well, in your collaboration?
5.	How did you benefit from working with a partner (or partners)?
